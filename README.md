DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository! This repository serves as a personal log for practicing and mastering important concepts in DSA.
If you're also learning DSA or want to explore various solutions and explanations, feel free to browse around!

üìñ About

This repository contains:
- Solutions to DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and more.
- Implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
- Explanations of approaches and problem-solving techniques.

üõ† Technologies and Tools

- Programming Languages: 
  - Primary: Python, C++, Java
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
- IDE/Code Editor: Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (for Java)

üöÄ Topics Covered

1. Arrays and Strings:
   - Array manipulations, sliding window, two-pointer techniques.
   - Common string operations: palindrome check, pattern matching, etc.
   
2. Linked Lists:
   - Singly and doubly linked lists, cycle detection, reverse linked lists.
   
3. Stacks and Queues:
   - Stack and queue implementation, problems like balanced parentheses, LRU Cache.
   
4. Hashing:
   - Hash maps, hash sets, and collision handling techniques.
   
5. Trees and Binary Trees:
   - Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
   
6. Graphs:
   - Graph representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm.
   
7. Sorting and Searching Algorithms:
   - Quick sort, merge sort, binary search, etc.
   
8. Dynamic Programming (DP):
   - Common DP problems like knapsack, longest common subsequence, and memoization techniques.
   
9. Greedy Algorithms:
   - Activity selection, fractional knapsack, and coin change problems.
   
10. Recursion and Backtracking:
    - Classic problems like the Tower of Hanoi, n-Queens, and permutations.
    
11. Miscellaneous Topics:
    - Bit manipulation, divide and conquer, mathematical algorithms.

üìù Folder Structure

The repository is structured by topic. Each folder contains:
- Problem Statements: A markdown file with a description of the problem.
- Solution Code: Code files with detailed comments explaining the approach.
- Explanation/Notes: If necessary, an additional markdown file with a more in-depth explanation of the algorithm or problem-solving strategy.
